Below are the combined topics \(Mina and Mengfei\)Research topics for PhD thesesClinical endpoints 

* Ø  Mortality
  * o   Predictors of mortality
  * §  H. van der Holst et alàinvestigated baseline SVD characteristics associated with 8-year mortality
  * §  Potential predictors: progression of MRI/DTI SVD-markers and cognitive decline over time in relation to mortality
  * 
* Ø  Dementia
  * o   Predictors of dementia
  * §  I. van Uden et al à investigated baseline SVD characteristics associated 5-year incidence of dementia
  * §  Potential predictors: progression of MRI/DTI SVD-markers over time in relation to dementia and cognitive decline
  * 
* Ø  Parkinsonism \(maybe collaboration with Mayra?\)
  * o   Predictors of Parkinson
  * §  H. van der Holst et alàinvestigated baseline SVD characteristics associated with 5-year incidence of parkinsonism
  * §  Potential predictors: progression of MRI/DTI SVD-markers over time in relation to incidence of parkinsonism
  * §  Mayra:  Cognitive performance between patients with and without Parkinsonism
* Ø  Correlate BBB dysfunction to:
  * o   Incident dementia
