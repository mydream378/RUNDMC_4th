* DCE-MRI: Pilot study
  * Booked: PrismaFIT on the 20th of June from 2.30 to 5pm
  * Before doing the pilot study, CMO approval is needed
  *  Promising results from Walter:

Today I saw the images and the very preliminary results of the diffusion attenuation curves, and they seem good/suitable.The CSF suppression pulse worked, which means that one of the greatest uncertainties seems to be tackled. Jose/Marcel many thanks for that!We hope to get some more detailed results in the course of next week. After that we will make a short report that will be shared.

* * Two forms will be filled in this week :
    * Sub-biobank
