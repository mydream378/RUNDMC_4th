# 20190607 discussion with Niels P. Riksen on blood samples and SVD



* stroke paper : \(Stroke. 2018;49:2910-2917. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.023192.\)
* other measurremetns on blood samples
* 50+ patients, labor-intensive,freshly
* Anil working PET scanning based on RUN DMC popoulation\_VINI funding
  * microglia activation and periperal inflammation\_from Rinks
* circulating cytokines can be detect in frozen blood
* proteomics: to look at the circulating proteins in the serum
  * biomarkers assocation with progression of SVD, like the protein pathway
  * blood sampel quality check in the freezer
* isolate PBMC from the blood freshly; then stimulate the PBMC , to see the difference between the PBMC between severity of SVD
* 500 cohort from Niels group: 4 time points every 3month in one year , heathy participants, from nijmegne students/ maybe can be binded with RUN DMC study
* Mina: inflamatory markers links with DTI \(whtie matter integrity\),, i.e early progression of SVD
