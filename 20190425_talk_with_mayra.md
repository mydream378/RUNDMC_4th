Projects background from Mayra:

* UPDRS scale evaluation has been done 2011, 2015, **Should we include this evaluation in the 4th wave?**
* Pipeline for the evaluation of parkinsonism:
  * See in brain atrophy 2018 Frankerik, nov 8,

    > * _Brain atrophy and strategic lesion location increases risk of parkinsonism in cerebral small vessel disease_
    >   * [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353802018304917?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353802018304917?via%3Dihub)

  * Parkinsonism; score &gt; 10,then, refer to outpatient for the confirmation 
  * dementia diagnosis: evaluate the dementia score first, then refer to the outpatient for confirmation

**Mayra projects working on:**

* Cognitive performance between patients with and without Parkinsonism 

  cognitive impairment and dementia

* Parkinsonism, gait and SVD; **motor reserve** comparable to \( brain reservation and cognitive brain \), maybe collaboration with Mayra
* Anil and esther works on brain network
* Tips from Mayra:
  * First collection data, then data handling, finally statistical learning
  * After data collection, send the letter to GP later on to follow the status of the patients
* Data collection :
  * MRI booking/ Book the small car first/outpatient room reservation/
  * Time slot for the outpatient clinic room \(only Wed, Friday\) in advance
  * Try to do NPO and MRI scan in one day
